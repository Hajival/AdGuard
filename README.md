# AdGuard-Home-Whitelist

A strict curated whitelist for AdGuard Home with a focus on maintaining privacy and security.

It also helps avoid ads, trackers and malware.

It's a great starting point for people who wish to run AdGuard Home in a strict whitelisting manner.

ℹ Please learn AdGuard Home's interface before using this list.

## 🗒 Aspects

I personally:

* Use no Apple products or services
* Use no social media sites
* Use no online shopping sites
* Live in Australia

The whitelist reflects those facts.

Check the whitelist first to see if it suits your needs.

## 👩‍💻 Updates
