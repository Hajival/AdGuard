# AdGuard-Home-Whitelist ✅

A strict curated whitelist for AdGuard Home with a focus on maintaining privacy and security.

It also helps avoid ads, trackers and malware, and blocks tracking and telemetry wherever possible.

It's a great starting point for people who wish to run AdGuard Home in a strict whitelisting manner.

ℹ Please learn AdGuard Home's interface before using this list.
