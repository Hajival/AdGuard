# AdGuard-Home-Whitelist

A strict curated whitelist for AdGuard Home with a focus on maintaining privacy and security.

It also helps avoid ads, trackers and malware.

It's a great starting point for people who wish to run AdGuard Home in a strict whitelisting manner.

ℹ Please learn AdGuard Home's interface before using this list.

## Aspects 🗒

I personally do not use:

* Apple products or services
* Social media sites
* Majority of online shopping sites

I personally use:

* Microsoft products
* Ubuntu
* Some Australian specific stores

Take the above into account and that I live in Australia. The whitelist reflects those facts.

👀 Check the whitelist first to see if it suits your needs.

## Updates 👩‍💻

I will update this repo infrequently and sporadically.

## Usage 🗃

Within AdGuard Home:

1. Add one 🛑 [blocklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/AdGuard-Home-Whitelist/main/base.txt).
2. Add one ✅ [whitelist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/AdGuard-Home-Whitelist/main/whitelist.txt).
3. Disable or remove all other lists you have added.

(Optional but recommended) copy and paste [disallowed domains](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/AdGuard-Home-Whitelist/main/dns_disallowed_domains.txt)
into AdGuard's "Disallowed domains" section at the bottom of "DNS settings" and save to keep a much clearer query log
