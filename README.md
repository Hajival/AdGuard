# AdGuard-Home-Whitelist

A curated strict whitelist for AdGuard Home with a focus on maintaining privacy and security.

It also helps avoid ads, trackers and malware.

It's a great starting point for people who wish to run AdGuard Home in a strict whitelisting manner.

## Aspects

I personally:

* Use no Apple products or services
* Use no social media sites
* Use no online shopping site
* Live in Australia

The whitelist reflects those facts.

Check the whitelist first to see if it suits your needs.

## Updates

I will update this repo infrequently and sporadically.
